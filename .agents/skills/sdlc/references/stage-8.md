# Stage 8 — Retro

Read this before any Stage 8 work. Retro is **the learning pass only** — one small thing after
every merge. Epic closure is a separate, once-per-epic step attached to the final child. The
landing ask forms are restated below (`references/rules.md` stays canonical).

## Learning pass (every merge)

`docs/context.md` is loaded at the start of every session, forever — a line added there is a
permanent tax on every future task. The retro's job is **curation, not transcription**; writing
nothing is a normal, frequent outcome.

**A learning qualifies only if a future agent would do the wrong thing without it** — a non-obvious
trap, a tool/library behavior that contradicts its docs, a constraint discovered the hard way.
Otherwise it belongs somewhere else, never both:

| Tempting to write | Where it actually belongs |
| --- | --- |
| What shipped / summary of the change | the PR + git history |
| Why we chose X | an ADR |
| How the system is now shaped | `docs/architecture.md` |
| What's next / next slice | the tracker |
| How we test this layer | `docs/test-strategy.md` |
| Review/process meta | nowhere — drop it |

**Format — enforced, not suggested:** append to the flat `## Learnings` list as **one dated bullet,
≤3 lines**, stating the trap and the rule. No per-feature headings, no report sub-structure. Budget:
**0–3 bullets per retro**; a fourth means you're transcribing.

**Prune before you append:** delete bullets whose gotcha is fixed, fold any that a doc/ADR/contract
now covers into that doc, rewrite superseded bullets in place. **Promote before you prune:** a
bullet that has now applied across two or more features is a standing rule, not a learning — move
it into `AGENTS.md`, `docs/test-strategy.md`, or an ADR, then delete it from the list. Keep the
whole section under ~30 bullets — at the cap, earn each new line by removing one.

If a learning, local-only tracker transition, or blocking correction changes a repository file:
check out and sync the default branch, then ask to land the edit there. Landing ask, by remote
state: **no remote** → "Approve the retro package — commit to {default branch}?"; **remote,
default branch unprotected** → "Approve the retro package — commit and push to {default
branch}?" under the same approval; **remote, default branch protected** → `plan/{NNNN}-{slug}` →
PR → merge, then confirm. Stage 8's learnings land before the next task or feature branch.

The epilogue lands **directly on the default branch by design, not as a feature PR**: its content
is post-merge fact (delivery record citing the merge, issue closures, shipped-behavior
reconciliation) — a PR cannot carry its own merge's record. The protected-branch PR path is the
only exception, forced by the remote, not chosen for ceremony.

## Epic closure (once, on the final child only)

First check whether the landed task completes its enclosing feature/epic. If child tasks remain:
**stop here** — no reconciliation, no parent-epic updates; name the next task and return to the
Stage 4 plan gate. Corrections to current-behavior claims discovered after merge are blocking
corrective work, not reconciliation — do them before the next task.

When all child tasks are complete:

1. Check out and sync the default branch.
2. Reconcile the feature's durable artifacts with what actually shipped: read the PRD, ADRs,
   frozen contract, architecture, security, test strategy, and tracker; write the narrative's
   **delivery record** (PRD Summary → Delivery) once, true, with evidence links; move any feature
   facts out of planned-changes sections into current-state sections; update stale delivery
   summaries against evidence. Preserve decision history — an Accepted ADR or frozen contract does
   not become implemented merely because it was approved. Keep the tracker authoritative for task
   status.
3. Verify every child is complete, update the parent epic's task checklist, and confirm the epic
   Definition of Done and end-to-end acceptance criteria. Confirm the `## Learnings` list in
   `docs/context.md` is within its ~30-bullet cap and prune to it. Local-only: make the checklist
   and `Done` transition in `docs/progress.md` part of this reconciliation.
4. Land all reconciliation repository edits on the default branch before completing the parent
   epic (wait for any `plan/*` PR to merge and confirm).
5. Only then update the external tracker: **GitHub** — child PRs close only their task issues, so
   ask for approval to update and close the parent issue explicitly. **Another external tracker** —
   verify whether its integration completed the parent; if not, ask before updating. Treat a
   local-only epic as complete only after its `docs/progress.md` transition has landed. Do not
   report the epic done until its authoritative tracker record is complete.
6. Offer the optional next step:

> Epic {key} done. The deep-review cadence expects one full audit per epic (or the project's
> chosen schedule) — per-task review misses what a whole-epic pass catches, and its findings
> enter the pipeline as a plan backlog (Stage 3).
> Optional:
>
> 1. `improve`, scoped to what this epic touched — the default audit implementation.
> 2. `improve next` to surface directions only; after choosing one, decline its planning step and
>    start `sdlc {chosen direction}`.
> 3. Start the next feature with `sdlc {feature}`.

This is disclosure, not a gate. The audit pass is the cadence, not a gate; `improve` itself is an
optional external skill described in `INSTALL.md` and may be substituted by any equivalent
structured review, but the findings route through Stage 3 either way. There is **no epic/issue
flag** — don't advertise one. When a chosen direction returns to `sdlc`, route it through Stage 1;
never accept an `improve` design or spike plan as a substitute for the PRD path.

## Drift, never hidden

If implementation drifted from the approved PRD, ADRs, or frozen contract, record the shipped state
in the artifact that owns it — apply the amendment matrix in `references/rules.md` → Amending
decisions. Ask before broadening the approved scope.
## Next

The pipeline is at rest after the landing. For the next feature, start at Stage 1 — read
`references/stage-1.md` before acting on it.
